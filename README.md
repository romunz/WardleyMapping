🛠️** Tools for Creating Wardley Maps**

✏️ **Using Excalidraw**
I started with Excalidraw, one of the most popular alternatives. A very intuitive tool for creating hand-drawn-style Maps. 
Excalidraw was showed and recommended during a webinar hosted by [Aleix Morgadas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleixmorgadas): _Wardley Mapping en Español, una introducción para aprender sobre los mapas_. 
This webinar was my first hands-on introduction to Wardley Mapping. 

🔧 **Using Visual Studio Code**
I installed the Wardley Maps Extension for VSCode for quick prototyping:

Open VSCode

Launch Quick Open (Ctrl+P or Cmd+P)

Paste the following command:

nginx

Edit
ext install damonsk.vscode-wardley-maps
Press Enter to install.
