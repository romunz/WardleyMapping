### 🛠️ **Tools for Creating Wardley Maps**

✏️ **Using Excalidraw**

I started with Excalidraw, one of the most popular alternatives. A very intuitive tool for creating hand-drawn-style Maps. 
Excalidraw was showed and recommended during a webinar hosted by [Aleix Morgadas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleixmorgadas): _Wardley Mapping in Spanish, an introduction to learning about maps_. 
This webinar was my first hands-on introduction to Wardley Mapping. 


🔧 **Using Visual Studio Code**

I installed the **Wardley Maps** extension for Visual Studio Code:

**Installation Steps**

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Launch the Quick Open panel using `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+P` (macOS).
3. Paste the following command into the input bar:
   `ext install damonsk.vscode-wardley-maps`
5. Press `Enter` to install the extension.
